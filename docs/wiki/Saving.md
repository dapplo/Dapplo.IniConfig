# Saving

```csharp
// Saves all section values back to the file that was loaded
// (or the first writable search path when no existing file was found).
config.Save();

// Async variant — does not block the calling thread:
await config.SaveAsync(cancellationToken);
```

> **Note:** Own `Save()` / `SaveAsync()` calls are automatically detected and never
> trigger the file-change monitor, so a save does not cause an unwanted reload loop.

## IBeforeSave hook

Implement `IBeforeSave<TSelf>` (or the non-generic `IBeforeSave`) to run logic before
the file is written.  Returning `false` cancels the save.

```csharp
[IniSection("Server")]
public interface IServerSettings
    : IIniSection,
      IBeforeSave<IServerSettings>
{
    [IniValue(DefaultValue = "8080")]
    int Port { get; set; }

    /// <summary>Validate before saving. Return false to abort.</summary>
    static new bool OnBeforeSave(IServerSettings self)
        => self.Port is >= 1 and <= 65535;
}
```

---

## IAfterSave hook

Implement `IAfterSave<TSelf>` (or the non-generic `IAfterSave`) to run logic after a
successful write.

```csharp
[IniSection("Server")]
public interface IServerSettings
    : IIniSection,
      IAfterSave<IServerSettings>
{
    [IniValue(DefaultValue = "8080")]
    int Port { get; set; }

    /// <summary>Notify other components after a successful save.</summary>
    static new void OnAfterSave(IServerSettings self)
        => Console.WriteLine($"Server settings saved — port {self.Port}");
}
```

## Change tracking before saving

Use `HasPendingChanges()` to avoid writing to disk when nothing has changed:

```csharp
if (config.HasPendingChanges())
    config.Save();
```

See [[Reloading#change-tracking]] for details on the dirty flag.

## Auto-save on a timer

See [[Loading-Configuration#auto-save-on-a-timer]] for the `AutoSaveInterval` builder method.
